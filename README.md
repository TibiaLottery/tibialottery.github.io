TibiaLottery Angular Development

This is the repository currently hosting http://dev.tibialottery.com

Development on this project relies pretty heavily on node and gulp.
If you'd like to develop on this project, you can clone this repo and run npm install in the directory (assuming you have node installed).
After everything is installed, you can begin development by running gulp development

All of the code you'll probably want to mess with is in /public
Whenever you build (done automatically through watchers), code gets compiled and placed in /build, and it's executed from there.
If you push, you'll need to commit the changes to build too.

I know this gets a bit messy, but this repo is also the website, so it needs the build folder.

Someday I hope to make this a better looking readme, but not right now.
